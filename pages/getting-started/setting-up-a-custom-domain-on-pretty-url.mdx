# Setting Up Your Custom Domain with PrettyURL

This guide will help you configure your custom domain or subdomain with our URL shortener service.

## Quick Setup

1. Log into your PrettyURL dashboard
2. Navigate to Settings > Custom Domains
3. Click "Create Domain"
4. Enter your domain name
5. Follow the DNS verification steps below

## DNS Configuration

### Option 1: Using a Subdomain (e.g., links.yourdomain.com)

Configure your DNS settings with the following CNAME and TXT records:

**CNAME Record:**
```
Type: CNAME
Host: links (or your preferred subdomain)
Value: connect.prettyurl.net
TTL: 3600 (or automatic)
```

**TXT Record:**
```
Type: TXT
Host: prettyurl-verification
Value: [Verification Code]
TTL: 3600 (or automatic)
```

Replace `[Verification Code]` with the code provided in your PrettyURL dashboard.

### Option 2: Using an Apex Domain (e.g., yourdomain.com)

Configure your DNS settings with the following A and TXT records:

**A Record:**
```
Type: A
Host: @ (or leave empty)
Value: 167.233.14.201
TTL: 3600 (or automatic)
```

**TXT Record:**
```
Type: TXT
Host: prettyurl-verification
Value: [Verification Code]
TTL: 3600 (or automatic)
```

Replace `[Verification Code]` with the code provided in your PrettyURL dashboard.

## Verification Process

1. After adding your DNS records, return to the PrettyURL dashboard
2. Click "Verify Domain"
3. The system will check your DNS configuration
4. Verification usually takes 5-15 minutes, but can take up to 48 hours (very rare) due to DNS propagation

## Troubleshooting

- If verification fails, double-check your DNS records
- Ensure you've waited at least 15 minutes for DNS propagation
- Verify that there are no conflicting DNS records
- Try using a DNS propagation checker tool to verify your changes

## Common Issues

- "Domain Not Verified": Wait for DNS propagation and try again
- "Invalid DNS Records": Ensure records match exactly as shown above
- "Domain Already In Use": Contact support if you own this domain

## Next Steps

Once your domain is verified:
1. Your custom domain is ready to use
2. All new shortened URLs can use your domain
