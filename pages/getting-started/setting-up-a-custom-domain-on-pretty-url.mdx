# Setting Up Your Custom Domain with Pretty URL

This guide will help you configure your custom domain or subdomain with our URL shortener service.

## Create the domain on Pretty URL

1. Log into your [Pretty URL Dashboard](https://prettyurl.net/dashboard)
2. Navigate to the Custom Domains page
3. Click "Create"
4. Enter your domain name
5. Follow the DNS verification steps below

## DNS Configuration

### Option 1: Using a Subdomain &#40;e.g., links.yourdomain.com&#41;    

Configure your DNS settings with the following TXT and A records:

**TXT Record:**
```
Type: TXT
Host: links (or your preferred subdomain)
Value: pretty-url-verification=[Verification Code]
TTL: 3600 (or automatic)
```

Replace `[Verification Code]` with the code provided in your Pretty URL dashboard.

**A Record:**
```
Type: A
Host: links (or your preferred subdomain)
Value: 49.13.45.44
TTL: 3600 (or automatic)
```

### Option 2: Using an Apex Domain &#40;e.g., yourdomain.com&#41;

Configure your DNS settings with the following TXT and A records:

**TXT Record:**
```
Type: TXT
Host: @ (or leave empty)
Value: pretty-url-verification=[Verification Code]
TTL: 3600 (or automatic)
```

Replace `[Verification Code]` with the code provided in your Pretty URL dashboard.

**A Record:**
```
Type: A
Host: @ (or leave empty)
Value: 49.13.45.44
TTL: 3600 (or automatic)
```

**Important Note:** If you are using something like Cloudflare to manage your DNS records, disable its proxy service. [For Cloudflare](https://support.cpanel.net/hc/en-us/articles/360050408634-How-to-disable-the-Cloudflare-proxy-for-your-domain), turn off the DNS proxy by clicking the orange cloud icon next to your DNS record until it turns grey.

## Verification Process

1. After adding your DNS records, return to the Pretty URL dashboard
2. Click "Verify Domain"
3. The system will check your DNS configuration
4. Verification usually takes 5-15 minutes, but can take up to 48 hours (very rare) due to DNS propagation

## Troubleshooting

- If verification fails, double-check your DNS records
- Ensure you've waited at least 15 minutes for DNS propagation
- Verify that there are no conflicting DNS records
- Try using a DNS propagation checker tool to verify your changes

## Common Issues

- "Domain Not Verified": Wait for DNS propagation and try again
- "Invalid DNS Records": Ensure records match exactly as shown above
- "Domain Already In Use": Contact support if you own this domain

## Next Steps

Once your domain is verified:
1. Your custom domain is ready to use
2. All new shortened URLs can use your domain
