# Handling Errors

When using our API you will most likely receive errors at some point. Errors will be returned in a JSON response format
such as the below example:

```json
{
    "status": "error",
    "message": "The route api/v1/endpoint-doesnt-exist could not be found.",
    "details": {
        // any additional error details
    }
}
```
