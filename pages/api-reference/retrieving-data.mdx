# Retrieving Data

When you make a request to our API, responses are returned in a standard format encapsulating the result of your query. The data is transmitted using the `application/json` content type, ensuring compatibility with a wide range of programming languages and systems.

## Response Format

The API response will generally adhere to the following structure:

```json
{
    "status": "success",
    "message": "API request processed successfully.",
    "data": {
        "link": {
            "id": "string",
            "title": "string",
            "domain": "string",
            "group": {
                "id": "string",
                "name": "string",
                "created_at": "datetime"
            },
            "back_half": "string",
            "short_link": "string",
            "original_link": "string",
            "updated_at": "datetime",
            "created_at": "datetime"
        }
    }
}
```

### Breakdown of the Response

- **status**: A string indicating the success or failure of the API request. This will either be `"success"`: which
indicates that the request was processed successfully OR `"error"` which indicates that there was an error in processing the request.
- **message**: A string providing additional information about the result of the API request. This can include success messages or error descriptions.
- **data**: This is the main payload of the response, containing the requested information.

If there is an error, you will see a **details** object instead of **data** with any relevant errors such as in the event of a
validation error. You can read more on the [Handling Errors](/api-reference/handling-errors) page.
