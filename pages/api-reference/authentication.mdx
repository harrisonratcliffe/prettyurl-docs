# Authentication

To access the API, you must provide an API key, which can be created through the [Pretty URL Dashboard](https://prettyurl.net/dashboard/account/api-keys).

### Authentication Process

When making API requests, add the API key in the Authorization header as a bearer token. For example:

```
Authorization: Bearer <API_KEY>
```

### IP Restrictions

Currently, when API keys are created they can be used from any IP address. We are working to make it possible to restrict API keys to certain IP's.

### Secrets Management

We do not keep a recoverable record of your API key secret. It will only be visible in the dashboard for a limited time following its creation.

If you lose the secret, you can delete the AIP key and create a new one.
