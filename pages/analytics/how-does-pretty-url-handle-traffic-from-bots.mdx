# How does Pretty URL handle traffic from bots

Pretty URL filters bot traffic to the best of our ability using sophisticated bot detection mechanisms to minimize automated traffic interference. However, some bot-generated visits may still slip through our filtering process.

The traffic validation system aims to provide accurate visit metrics by identifying and filtering out known automated sources and large-scale traffic manipulation attempts. While robust, it cannot comprehensively prevent all forms of intentional traffic inflation or complex visit fraud.

We also no not count a visit as a new one if it's by same visitor within 1 minute.
